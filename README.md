# Helsinki Region Travel Time comparison application, the shinyapps.io deployment

This data analysis application was developed for my University of Helsinki Master's thesis, *Parking private cars and spatial accessibility in Helsinki Capital Region â€“ Parking time as a part of the total travel time*.

## About this application

In this Master's thesis, as one of the research questions, I set out to find if there are differences in door-to-door travel times in two datasets, the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix 2018 and the research survey dataset collected by me for this thesis.

Presented in Salonen & Toivonen 2013, the door-to-door approach in travel time calculation includes all parts of a private car trip into account. Therefore, a trip in this research consists of:
- Walking from the origin to one's car
- Driving to destination
- Searching for parking
- Walking from one's parked car to the destination

In Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix 2018, the searching for parking segment has been a static value of 0.42 minutes everywhere in the dataset. Using the collected survey data, the travel time comparison application presented in this repository calculates a wide variety of different scenarios using Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix 2018 data, the research survey data, and comparisons of these two datasets.

**[The travel time comparison application is available for viewing at shinyapps.io](https://sampoves.shinyapps.io/comparison/)**.

The thesis is available as PDF at the Digital Repository of the University of Helsinki: **http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:hulib-202010304366**. See the section [Associated repositories](#associated-repositories) for all GitHub repositories associated with this thesis.
